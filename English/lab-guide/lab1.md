**Note:** Some of the screenshots may be out of date due to ongoing
product updates.

# Scenario / Problem Statement

Fabrikam, Inc. is a wholesale novelty goods distributor. As a
wholesaler, Fabrikam's customers are mostly companies who resell to
individuals. Fabrikam sells to retail customers across the United States
including specialty stores, supermarkets, computing stores, and tourist
attraction shops. Fabrikam also sells to other wholesalers via a network
of agents who promote the products on Fabrikam's behalf. While all
Fabrikam's customers are currently based in the United States, the
company is intending to push for expansion into other countries /
regions.

You are a Data Analyst in the Sales team. You collect, clean, and
interpret data sets to solve business problems. You also put together
visualizations like charts and graphs, write reports, and present them
to the decision-makers in the organization.

In order to draw valuable insights from the data, you pull data from
multiple systems, clean it and mash it together. You pull data from the
following sources:

- **Sales Data:** comes from the ERP system and data is stored in an
  ADLS Gen2 database. It gets updated at noon / 12 PM every day.

- **Supplier Data:** comes from different suppliers and data is stored
  in a Snowflake database. It gets updated at midnight / 12 AM every
  day.

- **Customer Data:** comes from Customer Insights and data is stored in
  Dataverse. The data is always up to date.

- **Employee Data:** comes from the HR system; it is stored as an export
  file in a SharePoint folder. It gets updated every morning at 9 AM.

  ![A diagram of data flow](../media/lab-01/image6.png)

You are currently building a semantic model in Power BI Premium that
pulls the data from the above source systems to satisfy your reporting
needs as well as provide end users with the ability to self-serve. You
use Power Query to update your model.

**You are facing the following challenges:**

- You need to refresh your dataset at least three times a day to
  accommodate the different update times for the different data sources.

- Your refreshes take a long time, as you need to do a full refresh every
  time to capture any updates that happened to the source systems.

- Any errors in any of the data sources that you are pulling from will
  result in your dataset refresh breaking. A lot of times the employee
  file does not upload on time resulting in your dataset refresh
  breaking.

- It takes a very long time to make any changes to your data model, as
  Power Query takes a long time to refresh your previews, given the
  large data sizes and complex transformations.

- You need a Windows PC to use Power BI Desktop, even though the
  corporate standard is Mac.

You heard about Microsoft Fabric and decided to try it to see if it
will address your challenges.

# Overview of Power BI Desktop Report

Before we start with Fabric, let's look at the current Report in Power
BI Desktop to understand the transformations and the model.

## Task 1: Set up Power BI Desktop in lab environment

1. Open the **FAIAD.pbix** located in **Reports** folder on the
    **desktop** of your lab environment. The file will open in Power BI
    Desktop.

    ![](../media/lab-01/image7.png)

2. Once the "Enter your email address" dialog appears, copy the **Username** and paste it into the **Email** field of the dialog and select **Continue**.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

     ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(3).png)
  
3. On the Sign into Microsoft Azure tab, you will see the login screen, enter the following Email/ Username and then click on **Next**.

   * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

     ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(4).png)

4. Now enter the following **Password** and click on **Sign in**.

    * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

      ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(5).png)

    ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(6).png)

Power BI Desktop will now open.

## Task 2: Analyze Power BI Desktop Report

The report below analyzes Sales for Fabrikam. KPIs are listed on the
top left of the page. The remaining visuals highlight Sales over time,
by Territory, Product Group, and Reseller Company.

![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop
report](../media/lab-01/image15.png)

**Note:** In this training, we are focusing on data acquisition,
transformation, and modeling using tools available in Fabric. We will
not be focusing on report development or navigation. Let's spend a
couple of minutes understanding the report and move to the next steps.

1. Let's analyze data by Sales Territory. Select **New England from the
    Sales Territory** (Scatter plot) visual. Notice from the Sales over
    time, Reseller Tailspin Toys has more sales compared to Wingtip Toys
    in New England. If you look at the Sales YoY% column chart you will
    notice that Wingtip Toys sales growth has been low and declining
    quarter over quarter during the past year. After a small rebound in
    Q3 it went down again in Q4.

    ![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop report with New England
selected](../media/lab-01/image17.png)

2. Let's compare this to the Rocky Mountain territory. Select **Rocky
    Mountain from Sales Territory** (Scatter plot) visual. Notice in the
    Sales YoY% column chart, sales for Wingtip Toys have increased
    dramatically in 2023 Q4 after being low for the previous two
    quarters.

    ![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop report with Rocky Mountain
selected](../media/lab-01/image19.png)

3. Select **Rocky Mountain from Sales Territory** to remove the filter.

4. From the Scatter plot visual at the bottom center of the screen
    (Sales Orders by Sales) select the outlier on the top right (4th
    quadrant). Notice the margin % is 52%, which is above the average of
    50%. Also, the Sales YoY% has gone up in the last two quarters of 2023.

    ![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop with Scatter plot
selection](../media/lab-01/image21.png)

5. Select the outlier Reseller in the Scatter plot visual to **remove
    the filter**.

6. Let's get the Product details by Product Group and Reseller. From
    the Sales by Product Group and Reseller Company bar chart visual,
    **right click on the Packaging Materials bar for Tailspin Toys** and
    from the dialog select **Drill through -> Product Detail**.

    ![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop with Drill through
selection](../media/lab-01/image23.png)

7. You will be navigated to the page that provides the Product
    Details. Notice there are some future orders in place as well.

8. Once you are done reviewing this page, select the **Ctrl+back
    arrow** on the top right of the page to navigate back to the
    Sales Report.

    ![A screenshot of Power BI Desktop Product Details
page](../media/lab-01/image25.png)

9. Feel free to further analyze the report. Once ready, let's look at
    the model view. From the left panel, select **Model view icon**.
    
    ![](../media/lab-01/image27.png)

10. Notice there are two fact tables, Sales and PO.

    a. Granularity of Sales data is by Date, Reseller, Product, and People. Date, Reseller, Product, and People connect to Sales.

    b. Granularity of PO data is by Date, Product, and People. Date, Product, and People connect to PO.

    c. We have Supplier data by Product. Supplier connects to Product.

    d. We have Reseller's location data by Geo. Geo connects to Reseller.

    e. We have Customer information by Reseller. Customer connects to Reseller.

## Task 3: Review Power Queries

1. Let's look at Power Query to understand the data sources. From the ribbon, select **Home -> Transform data**
    
      ![](../media/lab-01/image28.png)

2. Power Query window opens. From the ribbon, select **Home -> Data** **source settings**. Data source settings dialog opens. As you scroll through the list, you will notice there are four data sources as mentioned in the problem statement:

    - Snowflake

    - SharePoint

    - ADLS Gen2

    - Dataverse

3. Select **Close** to close the Data source settings dialog.

    ![](../media/lab-01/image29.png)

4. In the left Queries panel, notice that the queries are grouped by data source.

5. Notice **DataverseData** folder has Customer data available in four different queries: Customer, BabyBoomer, GenX, GenY, and GenZ. These four queries are appended to create the Customer query.

6. Click on the **Customer** Query from the Queries window. Selecting this query will require that you re-enter your Dataverse credentials. Click **Edit Credentials**.

    ![](../media/lab-01/image31.png)

    ![](../media/lab-01/image32.png)

7. Click on **Sign in** to log into your account.

   ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(1).png)

8. You can enter the credentials for the Dataverse data source by
    entering the **Username** and **Password**. The credentials are
    provided below, and select **Connect**.

    - Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

    - Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

      ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(2).png)

9. Click on the **ADLS Base Folder** Query from the Queries window.
    Selecting this query will require the credentials. Click **Edit
    Credentials**.
    
      ![](../media/lab-01/image33.png)

10. For the ADLS data source, choose the **Shared access signature
    (SAS)** option and enter the **SAS token** provided below. Then,
    select **Connect**.

    - **SAS token:** <inject key="Sas token"></inject>

      ![](../media/lab-01/image34.png)

11. Notice the **ADLSData** folder has multiple dimensions: Geo,
    Product, Reseller, and Date. It also has Sales facts.

    - **Geo dimension** is created by merging data from Cities,
      Countries, and States query.

    - **Product dimension** is created by merging data from Product
      Groups and Product Item Group query.

    - **Reseller dimension** is filtered using BuyingGroup query.

    - **Sales fact** is created by merging InvoiceLineItems with Invoice
      query.

12. For the Snowflake data source, select the **SupplierCategories**
    query from the Queries window. Selecting this query will prompt you
    for credentials. Click **Edit Credentials**.
    
      ![](../media/lab-01/image35.png)

13. Enter the **Snowflake Username** and **Snowflake Password** provided below. Use these credentials to connect all the tables under Snowflake to Snowflake and then select **Connect**.

    * **Snowflake Username:** <inject key="SnowFlake Username"></inject>
    
    * **Snowflake Password:** <inject key="SnowFlake Password"></inject>

      ![A screenshot to copy credentials](../media/lab-01/21042025(7).png)

      >**Note:** If you encounter any issues connecting to Snowflake, please use the credentials provided below.

      - **Snowflake Username:** SNOWFLAKE_BACKUP

      - **Snowflake Password:** 8UpfRpExVDXv2AC1

      >**Note:** Please Do Not enter the wrong username or password more than three times, as this will lock the Snowflake account for everyone. If you’re having trouble logging in, please contact `cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com` instead of trying multiple times.

14. Notice the **SnowflakeData** folder has Supplier dimension and
    PO(Order / Spend) fact.

    - **Supplier dimension** is created by merging Suppliers query with
      SupplierCategories query.

    - **PO fact** is created by merging PO with PO Line Items query.

15. For the SharePoint data source, select the **People** query from the
    Queries window. Selecting this query will prompt you for
    credentials. Click **Edit Credentials**.
    
      ![](../media/lab-01/image36.png)

16. Select the **Microsoft account** option, then click **Sign in**.
    Enter the Username and Password provided below, and then select
    **Connect**.

    - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

    - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

      ![](../media/lab-01/image37.png)

17. Notice the **SharepointData** folder has People dimension.
    
      ![](../media/lab-01/image38.png)

Now we know what we are dealing with. In the following labs, we will
create a similar Power Query using Dataflow Gen2 and do modeling using a
Lakehouse.
