# Fabric License

## Task 1: Enable a Microsoft Fabric trial license

1. On the lab VM desktop, open the **browser** and navigate to [Microsoft Power BI Portal](https://app.powerbi.com/). You will be navigated to the login page.

    >**Note:** If you're using the lab environment, it may sign you
    automatically.

    >**Note:** If you are not using the lab environment and have an existing
    Power BI account, you may want to use the browser in private / incognito
    mode.

2. Copy the Username and paste it into the Email field of the dialog and select Submit.

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

        ![A screenshot of create account page](../media/lab-02/image6.png)

3. On the **Sign into Microsoft Azure** tab, you will see the login screen. Enter the following **Email/Username** and then click on **Next**.

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

        ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/lab-02/image7.png)

4. Now enter the following **Password** and click on **Sign in.**

   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

        ![](../media/lab-02/image8.png)

5. You will be navigated to the familiar **Power BI Service Home page**.

6. We assume you are familiar with the layout of Power BI Service. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask the instructor.

    Currently, you are in the **My Workspace**. To work with Fabric items,
    you will need a trial license and a workspace that has Fabric license
    assigned. Let's set this up.

7. On the top right corner of the screen, select the **user** **icon**.

8. Select **Free trial**.

    ![](../media/lab-02/image9.png)

# Fabric Workspace

## Task 2: Create a Fabric Workspace

1. Now let's create a workspace with a Fabric license. Select **Workspaces** **(1)** from the left navigation bar. A dialog opens.

2. Click **+ New workspace** **(2)** found at the bottom of the pop-out menu.

    ![](../media/lab-02/image13.png)

3. **Create a workspace** dialog opens on the right side of the browser.

4. In the **Name** field enter **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**

    >**Note:** The workspace name must be unique. Make sure a green check mark with "This name is available" is displayed below the Name field.

5. If you choose, you can enter a Description for the workspace. This is an optional field.

6. Click on **Advanced** to expand the section.

   ![A screenshot of a computer](../media/lab-02/image14(1)upd.png)

7. Under **License mode**, make sure **Trial** is selected. (It should be selected by default.)

8. Select **Apply** to create a new workspace.

    ![](../media/lab-02/image15-upd.png)

    A new workspace has been created, and you will be able to navigate into
    this workspace. We will bring data from the different data sources into
    a Lakehouse and use the data from the Lakehouse to build our model and
    report on it. The first step is to create a Lakehouse.

## Task 3: Create a Lakehouse

1. In the newly created workspace **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**, locate the **+ New item (1)** button on the left-hand navigation pane. This is where you can begin creating new items in your workspace.

2. In the search box, type **Lakehouse (2)** and, from the search results, select the **Lakehouse (3)** option. This will enable you to create a new Lakehouse to store, query, and manage your big data.

    ![](../media/lab-02/image16.png)

3. A new lakehouse dialog will appear. Enter **lh_FAIAD** in the Name textbox.

   >**Note:** lh here refers to Lakehouse. We are prefixing lh so that it is easy to identify and search.
  
   >**Note:** The preview feature of **Lakehouse Schemas** is very interesting, so it is something you should be aware of. Since it is in **Preview** state, we will ignore it so there is no negative impact on the lab experience. Once the feature is generally available, we will bring it into this lab.

4. Select **Create**.

   ![](../media/lab-02/image17-upd.png)

    Within a few moments, a Lakehouse is created, and you will be navigated
    to the Lakehouse interface. On the left panel, notice that below your
    workspace, you will have the Lakehouse icon. You can easily navigate to
    the Lakehouse by clicking on this icon at any time.

    Within the Lakehouse Explorer, you will notice Tables and Files.
    Lakehouse could expose Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 files under the
    files section, or a dataflow could load data to Lakehouse tables. There
    are various options available. We are going to show you some of the
    options in the following labs.
